A compiler that generates the bytecode (.class) for Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 

Syntax and semantics of the language are specified in the documentation. The language is similar to Java 
with additional features of SET operations overloaded over native operators. 

The generated byte code is optimized to run on JRE.
