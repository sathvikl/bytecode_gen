A compiler that generates the bytecode (.class) for Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 

Syntax and semantics of the language are specified in the documentation. The language is similar 
to Java with additional features of SET operations overloaded over native operators (+/-). 

The package name is edu.ufl.cise.cop5555.sp12.codegen
The src is located in bytecode_gen/CompilerCodeGenJVM/src/edu/ufl/cise/cop5555/sp12

In order to generate the java class files it uses asm.jar available at http://asm.ow2.org/ 
and packaged as org.objectweb.asm which is a java bytecode manipulation framework. 
It also has a byte outline plugin for eclipse to see the ASMied Java byte code. 

jd-gui is a simple GUI to decompile the generated class file and view the java source 
which can be very helpful with debugging. 

The generated byte code is optimized to run on JRE.
